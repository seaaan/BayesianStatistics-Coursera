## Background for lesson 1

### Rules of probability
Probabilities are between 0 and 1, with the summed probabilities of all possible events equalling 1
    Notation: 
        P(A) = 1/6 means probability of event A = 1/6
        P(x = 4) = 1/2 means probability of x equalling 4 is 1/2
Probability of an event + probability of its complement = 1
Probability of A or B = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B)

### Odds
Odds are the probability of an event divided by the probability of its complement
    E.g., P(rolling 3) = (1/6)/(5/6) = 1/5, also known as 1:5
To get probability from odds, for event A with odds a:b, do as follows: 
    a/b = P(A)/(1-P(A)) 
    P(A) = a/(a+b)

### Expectation
Expected value of a variable is an average of the values the variable can take, weighted with the probabilities for each value
    For example, each face of a die has the same probability (1/6), so the expected value is 1/6 * sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 3.5
